A. Firebase Project Configuration (Dev and Prod)

Create two separate Firebase projects:

One labeled Development

One labeled Production

For each project, enable Email/Password Authentication.

For each project, create a Firestore Database.

Set Firestore to test mode during initial setup.

Register a Web App in each Firebase project.

Record the Firebase configuration parameters for each project:

apiKey

authDomain

projectId

storageBucket

messagingSenderId

appId

B. Local Development Setup

Create a local project directory for the website.

Define a configuration selection mechanism to switch between:

Development Firebase configuration

Production Firebase configuration

Initialize Firebase using the Development configuration during testing.

Verify that all authentication and database operations point to the Development project.

C. Authentication and User Management

Implement user registration using Firebase Authentication.

Upon successful registration, create a corresponding user document in Firestore.

Store user metadata including:

user ID

email

role (default: user)

Manually assign the admin role to selected users via Firestore.

Enforce authentication checks before allowing access to protected pages.

D. Role-Based Access Control

Restrict access to the admin interface based on user role.

Redirect unauthorized users attempting to access admin resources.

Prevent unauthenticated users from accessing internal pages.

E. Event Management (Admin Operations)

Provide an admin-only interface for event creation.

Capture event attributes:

title

description

date

creator ID

timestamp

Store events as individual documents in an events collection.

Ensure event creation operations are only permitted for admin users.

F. Event Feed Distribution (User Operations)

Retrieve the list of events from the events collection.

Display events on the user dashboard in a feed-style layout.

Ensure event data is read-only for non-admin users.

G. Event Registration Workflow

Allow authenticated users to register for an event.

On registration, create a record in a registrations collection.

Store references to:

event ID

user ID

registration timestamp

Prevent duplicate registrations for the same user-event pair.

Reflect registration status in the user interface.

H. Data Architecture Enforcement

Maintain separate collections for:

users

events

registrations

Treat registrations as relational records, not embedded objects.

Ensure all records are traceable to authenticated users.

I. Security Rules Implementation

Define Firestore rules to allow read/write access only to authenticated users.

Restrict event creation and modification to admin roles.

Restrict registration creation to the authenticated user only.

Prevent users from modifying or deleting records they do not own.

J. Deployment to Production

Switch Firebase configuration from Development to Production.

Build the final production-ready version of the website.

Deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

Verify that the deployed site connects exclusively to the Production Firebase project.

Perform post-deployment validation using production accounts only.

K. Operational Lifecycle

Use the Development project for future testing and feature validation.

Apply changes to Production only after validation in Development.

Monitor Firebase usage to ensure activity remains within free-tier limits.

Decommission the system at end-of-life by disabling authentication and database access.
